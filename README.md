### Planning note

If you're already using the library, I'm looking at redesigning some of the core components to make this library more reliable and deal with some lingering bugs. Please give me feedback on how you're using it [here](https://github.com/splitwise/TokenAutoComplete/issues/272)

### Upgrading from 1.* to 2.0

There is one breaking change from 1.* to 2.0. You need to extend ```TokenCompleteTextView<Object>``` instead of ```TokenCompleteTextView```.

TokenAutoComplete
=================

TokenAutoComplete is an Android Gmail style token  auto-complete text field and filter. It's designed to have an extremely simple API to make it easy for anyone to implement this functionality while still exposing enough customization to let you make it awesome.

Support for Android 4.0.3 (API 15) and up. If you need support for earlier versions of Android, [version 1.2.1](https://github.com/splitwise/TokenAutoComplete/releases/tag/v1.2.1) is the most recent version that supports Android 2.2 (API 8) and up.

Setup
=====

### Gradle
```
dependencies {
    compile "com.splitwise:tokenautocomplete:2.0.8@aar"
}
```
### Maven
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.splitwise</groupId>
  <artifactId>tokenautocomplete</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.8</version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```
### No build tools

[Download the jar file](https://github.com/splitwise/TokenAutoComplete/releases) and add it to your project

If you would like to get the most recent code in a jar, clone the project and run ```./gradlew jar``` from the root folder. This will build a tokenautocomplete.jar in ```library/build/libs/```.

You may also add the library as an Android Library to your project. All the library files live in ```library```.

Creating your auto complete view
--------------------------------

If you'd rather just start with a working example, clone the project and take a look.

For a basic token auto complete view, you'll need to

1. Subclass TokenCompleteTextView
2. Create a layout and activity for your completion view

### Subclass TokenCompleteTextView

You'll need to provide your own implementations for getViewForObject and defaultObject. You should return a view that displays the token from getViewForObject. In defaultObject, you need to guess what the user meant with their completion. This is usually from the user typing something and hitting "," - see the way gmail for Android handles this for example. Here's a simple example:

```java
public class ContactsCompletionView extends TokenCompleteTextView<Person> {
    public ContactsCompletionView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
    }

    @Override
    protected View getViewForObject(Person person) {

        LayoutInflater l = (LayoutInflater) getContext().getSystemService(Activity.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        TextView view = (TextView) l.inflate(R.layout.contact_token, (ViewGroup) getParent(), false);
        view.setText(person.getEmail());

        return view;
    }

    @Override
    protected Person defaultObject(String completionText) {
        //Stupid simple example of guessing if we have an email or not
        int index = completionText.indexOf('@');
        if (index == -1) {
            return new Person(completionText, completionText.replace(" ", "") + "@example.com");
        } else {
            return new Person(completionText.substring(0, index), completionText);
        }
    }
}
```

Layout code for contact_token

```xml
<TextView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/name"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:background="@drawable/token_background"
    android:padding="5dp"
    android:textColor="@android:color/white"
    android:textSize="18sp" />
```

Token background drawable

```xml
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
    <solid android:color="#ffafafaf" />
    <corners android:radius="5dp" />
</shape>
```

Person object code

```java
public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public Person(String n, String e) { name = n; email = e; }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getEmail() { return email; }

    @Override
    public String toString() { return name; }
}
```

Note that the class implements ```Serializable```. In order to restore the view state properly, the ```TokenCompleteTextView``` needs to be able to save and restore your objects from disk. If your objects cannot be made ```Serializable```, please look at [restoring the view state](#restoring-the-view-state).

### Create a layout and activity for your completion view

I'm adding some very stupid "contacts" to the app so you can see it work, but you should read data from the contacts data provider in a real app.

Activity code

```java
public class TokenActivity extends Activity {
    ContactsCompletionView completionView;
    Person[] people;
    ArrayAdapter<Person> adapter;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        people = new Person[]{
                new Person("Marshall Weir", "marshall@example.com"),
                new Person("Margaret Smith", "margaret@example.com"),
                new Person("Max Jordan", "max@example.com"),
                new Person("Meg Peterson", "meg@example.com"),
                new Person("Amanda Johnson", "amanda@example.com"),
                new Person("Terry Anderson", "terry@example.com")
        };

        adapter = new ArrayAdapter<Person>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, people);

        completionView = (ContactsCompletionView)findViewById(R.id.searchView);
        completionView.setAdapter(adapter);
    }
}
```

Layout code

```xml
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.tokenautocomplete.ContactsCompletionView
        android:id="@+id/searchView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

</RelativeLayout>
```

That's it! You can grab the objects the user tokenized with getObjects() on the TokenCompleteTextView when you need to get the data out.


Setting a prefix prompt
=======================

If you have a short prompt like "To: ", you can probably get away with setting a drawable on the left side of the ```TokenCompleteTextView```. If you have something longer, you will probably not want your prefix to take up the whole height of the view. If you would like to have a prefix that only indents the first line, you should use ```setPrefix```. This code is a little quirky when restoring the activity, so you want to make sure it only gets called on a fresh start in ```onCreate```:

```java
if (savedInstanceState == null) {
    completionView.setPrefix("Your bestest friends: ");
}
```

Custom filtering
================

If you've used the gmail auto complete, you know that it doesn't use the default "toString" filtering you get with an ArrayAdapter. If you've dug in to the ArrayAdapter, you find an unfortunate mess with no good place for you to add your own custom filter code without re-writing the whole class. If you need to support older versions of Android, this quickly becomes difficult as you'll need to carefully handle API differences for each version.

(NOTE: ArrayAdapter is actually well written, it just doesn't allow for easy custom filters)

I've added my own FilteredArrayAdapter to the jar file that is a subclass of ArrayAdapter but does have some good hooks for custom filtering. You'll want to be fairly efficient in this as it gets called a lot, but it's a simple process to add a custom filter. If you are using the TokenActivity above, you simply replace the line

```java
adapter = new ArrayAdapter<Person>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, people);
```

with

```java
adapter = new FilteredArrayAdapter<Person>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, people) {
    @Override
    protected boolean keepObject(Person obj, String mask) {
        mask = mask.toLowerCase();
        return obj.getName().toLowerCase().startsWith(mask) || obj.getEmail().toLowerCase().startsWith(mask);
    }
};
```

Duplicate objects
=================

In addition to custom filtering, you may want to make sure you don't accidentally miss something and get duplicate tokens. ```allowDuplicates(false)``` on the ```TokenCompleteTextView``` will prevent any tokens currently in the view from being added a second time. Token objects must implement ```equals``` correctly. Any text the user entered for the duplicate token will be cleared.

Responding to user selections
=============================

If you're solving a similar problem to Splitwise, you need to handle users adding and removing tokens. I've provided a simple interface to get these events and allow you to respond to them in the TokenCompleteTextView:

```java
public static interface TokenListener {
    public void onTokenAdded(Object token);
    public void onTokenRemoved(Object token);
}
```

We can modify the TokenActivity to see how these callbacks work:

```java
public class TokenActivity extends Activity implements TokenCompleteTextView.TokenListener {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        /* code from the initial example */

        completionView.setTokenListener(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void onTokenAdded(Object token) {
        System.out.println("Added: " + token);
    }

    @Override
    public void onTokenRemoved(Object token) {
        System.out.println("Removed: " + token);
    }
}
```

In Splitwise we use these callbacks to handle users selecting a group when adding an expense. When a user adds a group to an expense, we remove all the users in the group and the other groups from the array adapter. A user should only be able to select one group and it would be redundant to add users in the group to the expense again.

Programatically add and remove objects
======================================

You may want to prefill the list with objects. For example when replying to an email, you would want the To: and CC: fields to have the correct emails in them. You can use ```addObject``` to put these tokens in. If you are using ```TokenDeleteStyle.PartialCompletion``` , you will want to call ```addObject(obj, "completion text")``` to get appropriate replacement text, otherwise just call ```addObject(obj)```. You can also remove objects programatically with ```removeObject``` though this will remove all objects that return true when calling ```equals``` on them. If you have copies in the array, you may need to take special care with this.
Finally there is a ```clear``` function to empty the EditText and remove all the objects.

Letting users click to select and delete tokens
===============================================

There are three different styles of click handling build into the project. Please open an issue if you need some behavior beyond this with your code! It's relatively easy to add custom click handling, but I'm not convinced anyone would need anything beyond the ones I've provided. Call ```setTokenClickStyle``` to change the behavior.

#### TokenCompleteTextView.TokenClickStyle.None

This is the default, even though it doesn't match the Gmail behavior. When the user clicks on a token, the view will move the cursor in front of or after the token. Users should not be able to get the cursor in the token as this causes confusing behavior.

#### TokenCompleteTextView.TokenClickStyle.Delete

When the user clicks on a token, the token will be removed from the field. If you need some kind of confirmation, handle it with the onTokenRemoved callback and re-add the token if the user changes their mind.

#### TokenCompleteTextView.TokenClickStyle.Select

This behavior most closely matches the Gmail token field behavior, but I did not make it the default to simplify the initial tutorial. The first click on a token will unselect any currently selected token views, then it will call ```setSelected(true)``` on the selected token. If you want to change the colors of the token, you will need to add appropriate drawables to your project. In the test project, we have the following:

token_background.xml
```xml
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/token_default" android:state_selected="false" />
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/token_selected" android:state_selected="true" />
</selector>
```

token_default.xml
```xml
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
    <stroke
        android:width="1dp"
        android:color="#ffd4d4d4" />
    <solid android:color="#ffafafaf" />

    <corners android:radius="3dp"/>
</shape>
```

token_selected.xml
```xml
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
    <stroke
        android:width="1dp"
        android:color="#ffa4a4a4" />
    <solid android:color="#ff7a7a7a" />

    <corners android:radius="3dp"/>
</shape>
```

If you need more detailed view customization like changing a picture in the token or resizing the token, you will need to provide a custom view to use in the layout you inflate in ```getViewForObject``` and override ```setSelected``` in that view. You can then make appropriate changes to the view.

### Example custom view

In a view implementation (see ```com.tokenautocomplete.TokenTextView```):
```java
public class TokenTextView extends TextView {

    ...

    @Override
    public void setSelected(boolean selected) {
        super.setSelected(selected);
        setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(0, 0, selected ? R.drawable.close_x : 0, 0);
    }
}
```

contact_token.xml
```xml
<com.tokenautocomplete.TokenTextView
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/name"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:background="@drawable/token_background"
    android:textColor="@android:color/white"
    android:textSize="14sp"
    android:maxLines="1"
    android:ellipsize="end"
    android:padding="4dp"
    tools:text="Glenda Jönsson" />
```

Inflate your custom view:

```java
public class ContactsCompletionView extends TokenCompleteTextView<Person> {

    ...

    @Override
    protected View getViewForObject(Person person) {
        LayoutInflater l = (LayoutInflater)getContext().getSystemService(Activity.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        TokenTextView token = (TokenTextView) l.inflate(R.layout.contact_token, (ViewGroup) getParent(), false);
        token.setText(person.getEmail());
        return token;
    }
}
```

Custom completion delete behavior
=================================

We've defaulted to the gmail style delete handling. That is, the most recently completed token, when deleted, turns into the text that was there before. All other tokens simply disappear when deleted.

While this is the best in our case, we've provided a couple of other options if you want them. Call ```setDeletionStyle``` on the ```TokenCompleteTextView``` for different behaviors.

#### TokenCompleteTextView.TokenDeleteStyle.Clear

This is the default. The most recently completed token will turn into the partial completion text it replaces, all other tokens will just disappear when deleted

#### TokenCompleteTextView.TokenDeleteStyle.PartialCompletion

All tokens will turn into the partial completion text they replaced

#### TokenCompleteTextView.TokenDeleteStyle.ToString

Tokens will be replaced with the toString value of the objects they represent when they are deleted

Restoring the view state
========================

If your token objects implement ```Serializable```, the ```TokenCompleteTextView``` will automatically handle ```onSaveInstanceState``` and ```onRestoreInstanceState```. If you cannot make your objects ```Serializable```, you should override ```getSerializableObjects``` and ```convertSerializableArrayToObjectArray```. ```getSerializableObjects``` should return an array of ```Serializable``` objects that can be used to rebuild your original objects when restoring the view state. ```convertSerializableArrayToObjectArray``` should take an array of ```Serializable``` objects and use them to rebuild your token objects.

We use something similar to this at [splitwise](http://splitwise.com) to avoid saving complicated object graphs:

```java
@Override
protected ArrayList<Object> convertSerializableArrayToObjectArray(ArrayList<Serializable> sers) {
    ArrayList<Object> objs = new ArrayList<Object>();
    for (Serializable s: sers) {
        if (s instanceof Long) {
            Contact c = Contact.loadFromDatabase((Long)s);
            objs.add(c);
        } else {
            objs.add(s);
        }
    }

    return objs;
}

@Override
protected ArrayList<Serializable> getSerializableObjects() {
    ArrayList<Serializable> s = new ArrayList<Serializable>();
    for (Object obj: getObjects()) {
        if (obj instanceof Serializable) {
            s.add((Serializable)obj);
        } else {
            //obj is a Contact
            s.add(((Contact)obj).getId());
        }
    }
    return s;
}
```

Other options
=============
* Turn off making a best guess when converting text into a token (allows free entry)
```java
performBestGuess(false);
```
* Collapse the TokenCompleteTextView to a single line when it loses focus
```java
allowCollapse(true);
```
* Change the set of characters that complete a token
```java
setSplitChar(' ');
```
OR
```java
char[] splitChar = {',', ';', ' '};
setSplitChar(splitChar);
```
* Change the number of characters required to start showing suggestions
```java
setThreshold(1);
```
* Limit the total number of tokens in the field
```java
setTokenLimit(10);
```
* Turn off completing unfinished tokens when the view loses focus
```java
completeOnFocusLost(false);
```
* Prevent specific tokens from being deleted by overriding ```isTokenRemovable``` on your completion view
